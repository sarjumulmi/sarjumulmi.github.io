I am a fulltime civil/structural engineer but for some time now, I've been pursuing my dream to become a developer. I was always fascinated with softwares and the endless possibilities it could bring. Coming from an engineering background, I had a knack for analytical and logical thinking. But with programming, you can see your work come to fruition within a very short period of time. And you can build and test your work on sandboxes before you deploy, a luxury you can't have in my field.

That is how I embarked on this journey nearly 2 years ago to learn programming and development skills. I was lucky enough to find a mentor who introduced me to *Salesforce* and gave me access to some resources. At first, I started learning the point-and-click functionalities of Salesforce. But after couple of months, I actually wanted to learn how to code. So I started watching a lots of lecture videos on youtube, reading books and blogs etc. I enrolled for evening classes at a community college to learn Java and some Database. Eventually I got to a point where I was comfortable writing some codes on my own and also manupulate the front end. But after trying for months, I could not break in to the industry as a entry level developer.
I also felt that I have scant knowledge of web development in general.

I again started to learn the basic front-end and Javascript skills on my own for a while. But I soon realized thatt the ocean is too vast and without proper guidance and structure, I would be left stranded. That is why, after scouring the internet for months, I decided to enroll in Flatiron's Fullstack Web Development program. My goal from this program is not just learn coding skills but also to learn about web appliation developemnt, best practices, design patterns, and application architecture.
